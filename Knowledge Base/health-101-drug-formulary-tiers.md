# Drug Formulary Tiers

## Overview

Formulary tiers represent levels within a health insurance plan's prescription drug coverage list. Insurance companies organize medications into these categories based on several factors.

## Determining Factors

Tiers are determined by:

- Cost of the drug and how it compares to other drugs for the same treatment
- Drug availability
- Clinical effectiveness and connection to standard of care
- Additional cost considerations like delivery and storage

## The Four-Tier Structure

### Tier 1 - Generic Drugs

Lower-cost medications equivalent to brand-name drugs in strength and dosage, typically offering the smallest patient copayments.

### Tier 2 - Preferred Brand-Name Drugs

Brand-name drugs that are preferred by the insurance plan for their cost-effectiveness. These fall between generics and non-preferred options in price.

### Tier 3 - Non-Preferred Brand-Name Drugs

Brand medications the insurer doesn't prioritize, featuring higher patient costs than Tiers 1 and 2.

### Tier 4 - Specialty Drugs

High-cost medications used to treat complex or rare conditions. These typically require special handling, administration, or monitoring and carry the highest out-of-pocket expenses with possible additional restrictions.
