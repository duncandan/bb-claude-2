# How to Add Healthcare Providers

To help you shop for the best plan, we encourage you to add your preferred healthcare providers to your benefitbay® profile.

## Adding Providers

The process begins with an option to add healthcare providers and facilities important to you and your family. Select "Yes, add my provider" to proceed.

### Search Process

Search by entering the provider's name, facility, or specialty. Your home address zip code populates automatically. Click the blue "Search" button to find results.

### Verify Location

It is important to verify the address of your provider or facility. Providers may offer care from various locations. Location affects which plans are In-Network for you. Once confirmed, select the (+) symbol to add the provider.

### Assign Primary Care Provider

You can designate a provider as primary care. Select "Yes" to mark them as primary for each family member who will see them.

### Multiple Providers

If dependents have different providers, use "Add Provider" at the bottom to enter each one individually for the appropriate family member.

For each dependent with a different primary care provider, select "Yes" and click "Save Medical Provider" to assign them correctly.

### Final Step

After adding all required providers, click "Done" to proceed.

## Important Note

If you have a provider that is important to you or a loved one, we advise you to verify directly with the provider that they do accept the insurance plan you are interested in before completing the enrollment.
