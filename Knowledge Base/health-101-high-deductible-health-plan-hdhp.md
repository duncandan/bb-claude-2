# What is a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)?

## Definition

An HDHP is a health insurance plan characterized by higher deductibles than traditional plans, offset by lower monthly premiums. You pay more health care costs yourself before the insurance company starts to pay its share.

## 2025 IRS Requirements

For 2025, the IRS establishes these thresholds:

- Minimum deductible: $1,650 (individual) or $3,300 (family)
- Maximum out-of-pocket expenses: $8,300 (individual) or $16,600 (family)

## HSA Connection

An HDHP pairs with a Health Savings Account (HSA), enabling you to pay for certain medical expenses with money free from federal taxes.

## Ideal Candidates

An HDHP suits those who:

- Maintain good health with minimal medical needs
- Can cover deductibles upfront when unexpected medical bills arrive
- Have capacity for substantial monthly HSA contributions
- View HSAs as investment vehicles for long-term savings

This plan structure rewards healthy individuals who can financially manage higher upfront costs in exchange for lower premiums and tax-advantaged savings opportunities.
