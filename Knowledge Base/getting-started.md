## Welcome Email

You will receive (or may have already received) an email from the benefitbay® platform announcing you are eligible to shop for, enroll in, and purchase medical insurance benefits.

The email will be sent from **system@benefitbay.com**

You will receive an email (pictured below) from benefitbay to the email address we have on file for you when its time to setup your new benefitbay account. **Take note** of that email address because that will be the email address you use to log into the benefitbay platform.

To get started, click on the button "Set up a new password."

## Password Setup

You will then be redirected to a new web browser to set your new password. Here, you will create and confirm your new password. Please ensure you follow the password requirements.

To learn some tips on creating a secure password, [click here](https://knowledge.benefitbay.com/employee/creating-your-password?hsLang=en).

If you see that both password boxes are outlined in red when you have completed entering and confirming your new password, its because the passwords do not match. You will need to make the passwords match. Once the boxes turn green, click the "Set My Password" button, to save your password. You will then be directed to your Employee Home page.
