# What Is A Subsidy Advantage/Premium Tax Credit?

A **Subsidy Advantage (Premium Tax Credit)** is a refundable tax credit helping individuals and families with low to moderate income reduce health insurance premium costs.

## Eligibility & Affordability

If an ICHRA contribution is deemed unaffordable, employees may qualify for assistance. The amount of your Premium Tax Credit is based on a sliding scale -- the lower your income, the larger the credit you may receive.

## How It Works

- Credits are calculated using a sliding scale tied to income level
- Credits directly lower monthly premiums
- Can be applied as an Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC) paid directly to insurers monthly
