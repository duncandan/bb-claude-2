# Health Insurance Terms & Definitions

## Main Insurance Terms

**Premium:** The amount you pay for your health insurance every month, regardless of whether you use any medical services.

**Deductible:** The amount you must pay out of pocket for covered healthcare services before your insurance starts to pay.

**Copayment (Copay):** A set fee paid at the time of service for specific care or medications, independent of deductible status.

**Coinsurance:** The percentage of costs you share with your insurance after you've met your deductible. Example: 20% coinsurance means you pay one-fifth while the insurer covers the remainder.

**Out-of-Pocket Maximum:** The maximum amount you will pay for covered healthcare services in a plan year. After reaching this limit, your insurance will cover 100% of the costs for covered services.

**Network:** Healthcare providers offering services at reduced rates to plan members.

**Out-of-Network:** Healthcare providers or facilities not included in your insurance plan's network, potentially requiring higher patient payments.

**High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP):** A plan featuring higher deductibles paired with lower monthly premiums, typically used alongside HSAs.

**Health Savings Account (HSA):** A tax-advantaged account for qualified medical expenses, generally used with HDHPs.

## Additional Definitions

**Health Insurance Marketplace:** An online platform established under the Affordable Care Act allowing individuals, families, and small businesses to compare and purchase insurance plans through federal or state-based options.

**ICHRA:** An Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement is a type of employer-funded benefit that provides employees with tax-free reimbursement for individual health insurance premiums.
