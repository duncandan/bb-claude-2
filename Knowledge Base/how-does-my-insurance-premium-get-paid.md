# How Does My Insurance Premium Get Paid?

Understanding how ICHRA differs from traditional group insurance and how premiums are funded is essential for employees.

## What is ICHRA and How Do Premiums Get Paid?

ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement) allows employers to provide employees with a monthly pre-tax allowance for health insurance. Through benefitbay, employees receive an ARC account (pre-funded checking account) in their own name, replenished monthly by their employer.

**Do not use your personal bank account or credit card to pay all or part of your health premium.**

## Handling Premium Costs Above Your Allowance

ICHRA empowers employees as decision-makers. Your employer sets the monthly allowance; you choose the plan. The platform displays per-pay-period costs, enabling informed comparisons.

- **Plans costing less than allowance:** No additional paycheck deductions
- **Plans exceeding allowance:** Remaining balance deducted from paychecks by employer

## Accessing ARC Account Information

Log into benefitbay and select the "Coverage" tab in the left navigation. You'll receive routing and account numbers for premium payments.

## When to Use Your ARC Account

After plan selection, benefitbay's team submits applications and attempts initial payment setup. Some carriers require direct employee configuration. Support staff will contact you via support@benefitbay.com if assistance is needed.

**You may not use your ARC account to pay for health bills, prescriptions, co-pays, or any other services besides your monthly premium.**

## Important Notes

Your health plan belongs to you as the policyholder. If you leave your job, your plan remains yours.
