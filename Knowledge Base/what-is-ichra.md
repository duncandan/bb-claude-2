# What is ICHRA?

Your employer has announced they are switching your medical benefits from a group policy to something called ICHRA. But what exactly does that mean and how does it impact your coverage?

## What is ICHRA and how does it work?

ICHRA stands for "Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement." It functions as a health reimbursement arrangement enabling employers to provide monthly allowances for individual health insurance premiums.

Key features include:

- **Plan Selection Freedom**: Choose individual marketplace plans rather than employer-selected options
- **Cost Control**: Plans less expensive than the allowance cost nothing extra; more expensive plans involve payroll deductions
- **Portability**: Plans continue seamlessly if you change employers
- **Tax Benefits**: Premium payments use pre-taxed dollars and don't count as taxable income
- **ARC Account**: benefitbay provides an individual bank account (Advanced Reimbursement Checking) pre-funded by your employer
- **Autopay Setup**: Once configured, monthly premiums are automatically paid with additional amounts deducted from paychecks

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How does ICHRA differ from traditional group health insurance?

Traditional group insurance limits employees to one or two employer-selected plans. With ICHRA, you receive a fixed monthly allowance to purchase any available individual plan fitting your needs, providing greater control over coverage and out-of-pocket costs.

### 2. How do I choose an individual health insurance plan?

benefitbay simplifies the process through:

- Easy filtering by preferences
- In-network physician searches
- Premium and deductible sorting
- Plan selection with application submission handled by the enrollment team

### 3. How does my health premium get paid?

Your ARC account handles premium payments. The enrollment team pays your first month and attempts to set up autopay, though carriers may require your direct involvement. Contact support@benefitbay.com for autopay assistance.

### 4. What if I need help with the ICHRA process?

Support is available via support@benefitbay.com. Licensed enrollment team members can be scheduled for personalized assistance through links on your enrollment page.
