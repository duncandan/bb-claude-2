# Individual Policy Terminations

This guide helps employees notify their insurance carrier when switching to a new provider. Timely communication during carrier transitions is essential.

## Key Requirements

**Notification Timeline:** It is a best practice to notify the current carrier at least 30 days in advance to terminate your individual/family insurance coverage.

**Critical Constraint:** Individual insurance policies cannot be canceled retroactively and only the policyholder can initiate cancellation. This protects employers from double-payment situations.

## Notification Methods

Employees should contact their current carrier through either:

- Phone number on the back of their insurance card
- Formal letter to the carrier

Notification must occur before the policy's automatic renewal date.

## Template Letter

The following is a standardized termination letter template. Required elements include:

- Recipient (current insurance company name)
- Sender information
- Member ID number
- Current date
- Termination effective date
- Explicit request to remove automatic payments and stop billing

The letter should conclude with contact information availability and a professional closing.

## Critical Action Items

You must request the carrier to remove automatic payments and stop billing for the coverage to prevent continued dual-policy payments.
