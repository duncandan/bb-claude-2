# Qualifying Life Events (QLE) for Special Enrollments

## Overview

Outside the standard Open Enrollment period (November 1 -- December 15), employees need a Qualifying Life Event to trigger a Special Enrollment Period for purchasing health plans through ICHRA.

## What Qualifies as a QLE?

Qualifying events fall into four main categories:

### Loss of Health Coverage

Examples include losing insurance (except due to non-payment), aging out of parent coverage at 26, job-based coverage loss, or Medicaid/Medicare eligibility changes.

### Household Changes

Marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, or death in the family trigger eligibility.

### Residence Changes

Moving to a different coverage area, changing schools, or relocating between work/home locations qualify.

### Other Events

Becoming a U.S. citizen, release from incarceration, or a spouse's job/retirement changes forcing coverage loss are included.

## Key Process Requirements

Employees must initiate a change request on their own in their benefitbay profile promptly upon experiencing a QLE. Documentation may be required to verify eligibility. If not approved, the request is canceled, and applicants must wait for the next Open Enrollment to obtain coverage.

**Important:** Delaying action may result in missing your opportunity for changes in enrollment elections.
