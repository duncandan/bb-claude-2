# If I'm On Medicare Can I Reimburse My Premiums Through A Company Sponsored ICHRA Plan?

## Question

Can I pay my Medicare premiums with an ICHRA plan my company is offering?

## Answer

Yes, employees on Medicare or eligible for Medicare can use an Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) to reimburse premiums for Medicare and supplemental coverage.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify, individuals must have coverage of:

- Part A and Part B together, OR
- Part C

**Important:** Part B by itself doesn't qualify as Minimum Essential Coverage.

## Eligible Premium Types

The following premiums are eligible for reimbursement:

- Medicare Part A premiums
- Medicare Part B premiums
- Medicare Part C premiums
- Medicare Part D premiums
- Medigap (supplemental insurance) policy premiums

## Critical Rule on Medical Expenses

ICHRA can pay for medical expenses for Medicare participants (if allowed by the plan) but medical expenses cannot be designed around what Medicare pays or does not pay. This restriction is particularly important for plan administrators and participants to understand.
