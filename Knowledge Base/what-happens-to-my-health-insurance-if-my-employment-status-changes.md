# What Happens to My Health Insurance If My Employment Status Changes?

When employment circumstances change -- whether through job transitions, shift to part-time work, or retirement -- your health insurance coverage remains under your control as the policyholder. Since your medical coverage is completely portable, you have several meaningful options to consider.

## Your Three Main Options

### 1. Keep Your Plan

Maintaining your existing health insurance is possible by contacting your carrier to switch payment methods. You'll need to remove the ARC account and establish personal payment for the full premium.

Key advantages:

- Mid-year switching preserves deductible progress already met
- Avoids disruption if you're currently receiving ongoing medical care
- Prevents potential network changes with physicians
- Ensures continuity of coverage for services in progress

### 2. Terminate Your Plan

You can cancel coverage at any time by contacting your insurance carrier directly. Since the policy belongs to you personally, benefitbay and your employer is not able to cancel the plan for you. The knowledge base provides pre-written language to simplify this process.

### 3. Transfer Your Plan

If changing employers, your new company may also offer ICHRA benefits. In such cases, you can transfer your existing plan between employers seamlessly. Coordinate with your new employer about their ICHRA setup and transfer procedures.

## Key Takeaway

Maintaining control over your health insurance gives you flexibility to choose what best suits your circumstances and healthcare needs during employment transitions.
