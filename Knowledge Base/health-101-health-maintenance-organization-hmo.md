# What is a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)?

## Definition

A Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) is a network of hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers that agree to coordinate care within a smaller, local network.

## Key Features

HMOs typically require members to:

- Select a primary care physician (PCP) to manage their healthcare
- Obtain PCP referrals to see specialists within the network
- Receive coverage only from contracted "in-network" providers

Emergency care exceptions apply -- members may visit the nearest emergency room without referrals during medical crises.

## Advantages

- Lower premium costs
- Minimal or zero deductibles (depending on plan tier)

## Disadvantages

- Mandatory PCP selection
- Specialist referral requirements
- No coverage for non-emergency out-of-network care

## Best For

HMOs suit individuals prioritizing affordability over provider choice flexibility. The plan emphasizes lower costs with restricted access to healthcare providers outside the established network.
