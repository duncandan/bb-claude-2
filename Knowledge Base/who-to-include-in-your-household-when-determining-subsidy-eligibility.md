## Important FAQs

### Single Without Dependents

Count only yourself in household (unless you're claimed as someone else's dependent).

### Dependent Income

You should include the income of all dependents on your application, even if they're not required to file federal taxes.

### Joint Tax Filing Requirement

Married couples generally must file jointly to receive premium tax credits. Exceptions exist for head-of-household filers and domestic abuse/abandonment victims, who can claim unmarried status for coverage purposes without penalty.

### Household Members with Other Coverage

Include all household members and their income if they have job-based plans, Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, or self-purchased insurance.

### Dependent Claiming Insurance Independently

Those claimed as dependents on another's tax return cannot qualify for premium tax credits and must pay full price for Marketplace plans.
