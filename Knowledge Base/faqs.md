## I Am Unable to Shop for a Plan. What Do I Do?

Troubleshooting why you may not be able to shop for plans.

There are several factors that may prevent you from shopping for a plan upon logging into your benefitbay account. For an optimal experience, it is recommended that you access your account from a computer rather than a mobile device.

- It is important to check that your enrollment period is currently active. You can only shop for a plan once this period has begun. Currently, there are no options available to shop or preview plans prior to this time.

- Please confirm that you have completed the ICHRA and HIPAA agreement forms. Shopping for a plan or waiving coverage cannot proceed until these forms are electronically signed.

- Your dependent(s) may not meet the necessary coverage criteria, or there could be inaccuracies in their data entry. Please verify that birthdates and relationships are correctly entered, as any discrepancies may hinder your ability to shop for plans.

Please also review the article "Your ICHRA Enrollment Journey" for additional resources and detailed instructions to access the platform and shop for a plan.

Should you continue to experience difficulties shopping for a plan after reviewing these suggestions, you are encouraged to contact support at support@benefitbay.com for further assistance.

## Creating Your Password

How to create a secure password for your account to keep your information safe.

### Password Requirements

When creating a password for your benefitbay account, include:

- At least 12 characters in length
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 symbol

### Tips for Creating Secure Passwords

**Do Not Use Personal Information**

Avoid using names of family members, pets, addresses, phone numbers, or birthdays, as these details may be publicly available on social media or easily accessible to hackers.

**Do Not Use Real Words**

Password-cracking tools can "process every word in the dictionary, plus letter and number combinations until a match is found." Instead, combine uppercase and lowercase letters with special characters like "&" or "$" to increase complexity.

**Create Longer Passwords**

Aim for a minimum of 14 characters, as longer passwords are harder to crack.

**Modify Easy-To-Remember Phrases**

Think of a memorable phrase and use the first letter from each word, substituting numbers for some letters (example: "100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" becomes "10oBb0tW").

**Don't Write Them Down**

Never hide passwords under keyboards or post them on monitors. Be cautious when typing passwords in public settings.

**Change Passwords Regularly**

Update financial account passwords every one to two months and computer login passwords at least quarterly.

**Use Different Passwords for Different Accounts**

Using unique passwords prevents total compromise if one password is breached.

## How Do I Know Which Health Plan to Select?

Deciding the right plan for yourself and/or your family.

With an Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA), individuals gain flexibility to select health plans aligned with their specific needs, evaluating options based on deductibles, preferred providers, and location-specific features.

### How to Choose the Right Health Plan for You: A Guide to Help You Shop with Confidence

Choosing a health plan represents a personal decision requiring balance between individual healthcare needs and budget considerations.

**1. Start with how you actually use healthcare**

Reflect on recent healthcare utilization patterns, including doctor visit frequency, prescription medication use, and specialist consultations or planned procedures. Those with minimal doctor visits might prefer lower monthly premiums with higher deductibles, while frequent healthcare users may benefit from paying more monthly for lower deductibles.

**2. Check your doctors and prescriptions**

Verify that preferred doctors appear in-network and that necessary medications are included on the plan's drug formulary. Checking provider networks and formularies prevents coverage gaps.

**3. Decide how much flexibility you want**

Different plan types offer varying flexibility levels:

- **HMO:** One primary doctor; specialist referrals required
- **PPO:** Greater flexibility; specialists accessible without referrals
- **EPO:** No out-of-network coverage except emergencies; no referrals needed

**4. Look beyond the premium**

Evaluate total plan costs including deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, copays, and coinsurance rather than focusing solely on monthly premiums.

**5. Think about your lifestyle**

Consider geographic coverage needs, travel patterns, and preferred healthcare conveniences like telehealth, direct primary care, mental health services, and wellness benefits.

**6. Give yourself permission to ask questions**

Licensed education specialists can guide plan selection through virtual consultations accessible via the shopping platform's help option.

The right plan balances cost, convenience, provider access, and flexibility based on individual priorities and circumstances.

## Is benefitbay My New Insurance Carrier or Health Plan?

Your insurance carrier or health plan is not benefitbay.

benefitbay is a sophisticated software platform dedicated to the effective administration of ICHRA benefits. Rather than serving as an insurance provider, the platform connects employer contributions with appropriate health plan options for employees.

The system's purpose is to help both employers and employees succeed with ICHRA arrangements by facilitating health plan discovery and maximizing the use of employer contributions alongside payroll deductions.

For additional context, see "What is ICHRA?" for understanding the benefit structure, and "Who is benefitbay?" for learning more about the platform itself.

Contact: support@benefitbay.com

## How Do I Find a Provider or Know if My Provider is In-Network?

To verify if a provider is in-network, use your insurance carrier's online directory by searching "Carrier Name + Find Provider." You'll need your zip code and plan's network name (available on your plan card in benefitbay).

Calling the provider's office directly to confirm they accept your plan ensures accuracy, as online directories aren't always current.

When calling, have your exact plan name and network name ready. For HMO and POS plans, confirm your Primary Care Provider (PCP) is in-network and accepting new patients.

Important: Mention your plan is individual, not employer-sponsored, as some providers may not understand the distinction.

### Calling Scripts

**For Provider's Office:**
Ask to confirm the doctor is in-network for your individual plan (not group), provide the plan name and carrier, and inquire if they're accepting new patients.

**For Insurance Carrier:**
Request confirmation that the specific provider at their location is in-network for your individual plan and network.

For help adding providers to your benefitbay account, review "How to Add Healthcare Providers."

## Can I Change My Plan After Submitting?

You submitted your plan and now wanting to change your selection.

Once you select and submit your health insurance plan through your ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement), the selection is final for the entire plan year. Mid-year changes are only permitted if you experience a qualifying life event (QLE).

Because ICHRA uses individual market coverage following Affordable Care Act rules, federal law does not allow plan changes after open enrollment closes unless specific life events occur -- such as marriage, divorce, birth or adoption, or loss of other coverage.

### Recommended steps before enrolling:

- Review plan details including premiums, deductibles, provider networks, and prescription coverage
- Discuss options with available licensed education specialists
- Confirm your selection carefully before submitting

For employees who experience a QLE, see the separate resource about "Qualifying Life Events (QLE) for special enrollments."

## What is the Difference Between My Previous Group Plan and My New benefitbay ICHRA Plan?

### Group Plans:
- Selected by employers and provided uniformly to all employees
- Typically offer limited options that may not fit individual needs
- Financed through employer contributions with potential employee payroll deductions

### ICHRA Plans:
- Enable employees to personally select coverage aligned with their specific healthcare needs
- Provide access to multiple individual plan options available in your area
- Also financed through employer contributions with potential employee cost-sharing
- Allow colleagues to make active decisions about their own health insurance

### Comparison Recommendation

Review the Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) from your previous group plan to effectively compare it with the individual coverage plan options available in your area. This document provides detailed information about what each plan covers.

The shift from group to ICHRA represents a move away from one-size-fits-all coverage toward personalized health insurance selection, while maintaining employer financial support.

For more details, see "What is ICHRA?" or contact support@benefitbay.com.

## Can I Get Vision and Dental Coverage Through My ICHRA Plan?

ICHRA Health Care Plans using benefitbay are designated exclusively for major medical health care coverage.

Dental or vision plans -- even those obtained through a partner marketplace -- cannot be reimbursed using the benefitbay Advanced Reimbursement Checking (ARC) Account.

For questions about dental and vision benefits, contact your employer directly.

---

## How Is My Individual Healthcare Plan Paid For?

### Paying my health insurance premium

If you enroll in your employer's ICHRA plan, benefitbay will provide you with an Advanced Reimbursement Checking (ARC) account to cover your monthly health insurance premiums.

Key points about premium payment:

- It is crucial during the enrollment and application approval process to ensure that both your first month's premium and all subsequent payments are set to autopay.
- Use the ARC checking and routing number from benefitbay rather than your personal bank account.
- Once your enrollment is finalized, benefitbay will pre-fund the designated checking account to cover the full monthly premium.
- After your plan becomes effective, your share of the monthly premium (calculated as Full Premium minus Employer Contribution) will be automatically deducted from your paycheck according to your regular payroll schedule.

The employer determines defined contribution benefits, which may vary. Contact your employer directly for details about how your contribution benefit was calculated.

For more information about ICHRA, review "What is ICHRA?" or contact support@benefitbay.com.

---

## After I Submit My Plan Selection, Then What?

After completing your enrollment, benefitbay will submit your application in most cases. You should expect your insurance cards to arrive 7-10 days before your plan becomes effective. Upon receipt, create a login and set up your personal account on the insurance carrier's website.

Benefitbay typically handles submitting your ARC account payment information and setting up autopay with your selected carrier. However, monitor your email after selecting your plan, as some carriers require you to complete these steps directly, and assistance may be needed.

For more detailed instructions, review the "After Open Enrollment" article on the knowledge base.

## GLP-1 Medications

### What They Are and How They're Covered by Insurance

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) medications are increasingly used for Type 2 diabetes management and weight control. Common brands include Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro. These prescription medications work by helping manage blood sugar, slowing digestion, and reducing appetite, typically administered as weekly injections or daily pills.

### How GLP-1 Medications Work

These drugs function by helping your body manage blood sugar levels while slowing digestion and reducing appetite to support weight loss or diabetes control.

### Coverage by Use Type

**For Type 2 Diabetes:**
Most insurance plans cover GLP-1 medications when prescribed for diabetes management. Common covered brands include Ozempic, Mounjaro, Rybelsus, Trulicity, and Victoza.

**For Weight Management:**
Most insurance plans will typically exclude coverage for GLP-1 medications intended for weight management, even when prescribed by a healthcare provider. Weight loss brands like Wegovy, Zepbound, and Saxenda generally lack coverage.

### Finding Coverage Information

To verify GLP-1 coverage:

1. Access your plan card and view detailed information
2. Review the Summary of Benefits
3. Check the drug formulary for your specific medication and its tier
4. Note any prior authorization requirements or quantity restrictions
5. Confirm preferred pharmacy networks

### Key Takeaways

- Diagnosis matters: diabetes coverage differs from weight-loss coverage
- Prior authorization is typically required
- Use preferred pharmacies to minimize costs
- Formularies change; verify coverage with carriers directly
- Coverage varies across plans, even for identical medications

## How Do I Cancel My Health Insurance Plan?

As the policyholder, you must initiate cancellation directly with your insurance carrier -- not through your employer or benefitbay.

### Cancellation Steps:

1. **Contact your carrier** using the phone number on your insurance ID card and request cancellation plus payment stoppage

2. **Select the right effective date:**
   - December 31st if your new plan starts January 1st
   - Last day of the month before new coverage begins for other situations

3. **Obtain documentation:** Request and record a cancellation confirmation or call reference number for your records

4. **Submit proof:** Email your cancellation confirmation to support@benefitbay.com with subject line "Proof of Policy Cancellation"

### When to Cancel:

Cancellation may be necessary when leaving employment, switching plans during open enrollment, or if you no longer want the current coverage.

Individuals maintain full control over their plans and can make changes independently.

## How to Cancel Your UnitedHealthcare Policy

## How Do I Know if My Provider is In-Network with the Plan I Am Choosing?

When selecting a health insurance plan, it's important to confirm that your preferred doctors and facilities are in-network to avoid unexpected out-of-pocket costs.

### Four Ways to Verify Provider Network Status

**1. Enter Medical Providers on Your benefitbay Profile**

Users can add doctors and facilities to their benefitbay account through the "Medical Providers" tab. During plan shopping, the system displays network status using color coding: green indicates in-network providers, while red indicates out-of-network status. However, the tool may not always be 100% accurate.

**2. Call Your Provider's Office**

Contact the billing department directly with the specific plan name and carrier information. Important: providers may accept some plans from a carrier but not others.

**3. Use the Carrier's Website**

Most insurance carriers maintain online provider directories searchable by ZIP code and plan name. These resources are typically reliable and updated frequently.

**4. Call the Insurance Carrier**

Contact customer service as a prospective individual coverage shopper (not a current member) with the plan name and provider's full name and location.

### Important Reminder

Provider networks change regularly. Verification should be repeated during open enrollment, when changing plans, or before scheduling appointments. Cross-checking multiple sources provides the best assurance of coverage.

## How to Check If Your Medication Is Covered -- and What It Will Cost

If you take prescription medications, it is important to check whether the health plan you are considering covers them and what your out-of-pocket costs may be.

When reviewing plans, it is essential to examine two fundamental documents: the Summary of Benefits and the Drug Formulary.

### Summary of Benefits (SBC)

This is a simplified overview of what a plan covers and what you can expect to pay. It includes:

- **Deductible:** Certain plans may include a distinct medication deductible, which is the amount you are required to pay out of pocket before the insurance plan starts covering the costs of prescription medications.
- **Copay or coinsurance:** The amount you are responsible for paying, which may apply either before or after you have met your deductible depending on the medication tier.
- **Further restrictions or limitations:** These can be found in the far right column of the Summary of Benefits (SBC).

It is important to carefully review your Summary of Benefits (SBC) for specific details regarding the payment structure for each medication tier.

### Drug Formulary

A drug formulary is essentially a comprehensive list of prescription medications that are covered by your insurance plan. This list provides key information, including:

- The classification of the drug as either generic or brand-name
- The specific tier designation of the drug, which directly impacts your out-of-pocket costs
- Any applicable restrictions, such as:
  - Prior authorization requirements
  - Step therapy protocols
  - Quantity limits for prescriptions

Note: Tier 1 drugs are usually generics and cost the least, while higher tiers include brand-name or specialty medications and are more expensive. Each insurance carrier sets its own tier system, so the same drug may fall into different tiers depending on the plan and will vary across carriers. Knowing how your plan covers your medications can help you manage costs.

### How to Check If Your Prescription Is Covered and What It May Cost

1. Click on "Show more Details" to locate the Summary of Benefits and Drug Formulary
2. Click on and review the Summary of Benefits (will open in a new tab)
3. Within the SBC, scroll down to the medication section then click on the link for the drug formulary (opens a new window)
4. Use CTRL + F (or CMD + F on Mac) to search for your medication by name
5. The formulary will show:
   - The Tier your medication is in
   - Any restrictions (e.g., prior authorization, step therapy)
6. Return to the Summary of Benefits
7. Look for the section on prescription drug coverage
8. Find the tier to see the out-of-pocket cost for that medication
9. If tiers aren't labeled, assume the first listed is Tier 1, then Tier 2, and so on

### Important

Formularies can change at any time. For the most up-to-date medication information:

- Visit the insurance carrier's website directly
- Use the link to the carrier's formulary in the Summary of Benefits when available

## COBRA Coverage While on ICHRA

Does my employer need to offer me COBRA coverage? And how does it work with ICHRA?

### 1. What COBRA Normally Does

COBRA enables continuation of employer-sponsored group health plan coverage after qualifying events like job termination, with employees paying the full premium plus administrative fees.

### 2. What ICHRA Is

An Individual Coverage HRA differs fundamentally -- employers reimburse employees for individual health insurance premiums rather than providing group coverage.

### 3. How COBRA Applies to ICHRA

Because ICHRA qualifies as a group health plan under federal law, it is subject to COBRA. When employees lose eligibility, employers must offer COBRA continuation of the ICHRA benefit, meaning employees can maintain reimbursement rights by paying the full employer contribution plus 2% administrative costs themselves.

### 4. Practical Example

An employee with a $400/month employer ICHRA contribution who separates from employment would need to pay approximately $408/month under COBRA to maintain that benefit -- making it financially impractical for most people.

### 5. Key Points

- COBRA applies to ICHRA arrangements
- Election typically lacks financial merit since employees fund the reimbursement they receive
- Contact support@benefitbay.com for additional questions
