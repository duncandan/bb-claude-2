# Medical Plan Shopping

## Overview

The benefitbay ICHRA platform enables employees to personalize their health benefits by shopping the Individual Family Plan market. The company emphasizes that "the power of choice and personalizing benefits is the future."

To make informed decisions, employees should review the Health Insurance 101 articles covering insurance terminology, metal plan tiers, and drug formulary information.

## Step 1: Sign ICHRA Agreement

Before shopping, employees must sign the ICHRA agreement by selecting the "Shop" button. This document outlines how employer contributions are applied, premiums are paid, and employee contributions are deducted from payroll.

**Important note:** Employees must verify family members included in their shopping experience and confirm their address. Only the employee can enroll in a plan; "dependents remain ineligible without this requirement."

Unchecking family member boxes removes them from the shopping experience.

## Step 2: Shop for Medical Plans

The shopping interface displays available medical plans based on household members' ages and zip codes. Plan cards show monthly premium costs reflecting the employer's ICHRA contribution.
