# Product Principles

## Product Operating Model

**Our focus:** *Create the fastest path to the most value.*

We do this through four core capabilities, working together as a balanced system.

### Empathy

**Understand the problem**

We build deep understanding of customer and stakeholder needs, motivations, and constraints by listening to what they say and analyzing what they do before proposing solutions.

### Focus

**Prioritize what matters most**

We intentionally concentrate limited time and resources on the highest-impact opportunities.

### Validate

**Test and learn quickly**

We reduce risk by defining success upfront and validating assumptions through research, analysis, and experimentation/hypothesis testing.

### Vision

**Build with the future in mind**

We maintain and share a long-term product vision that aligns near-term execution with strategic direction.

## Design Principles

### Obvious

**Good products should just make sense**

We are building a once-a-year transaction; there should be no need for training and no time for friction for our users. Each step should be obvious.

### Familiar

**Work with what we know**

We must adopt design patterns from online tools our users utilize on a daily basis so taking an action on our system is familiar.
