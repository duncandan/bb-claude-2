## Common Themes in Feedback

### Plan Selection & Comparison (73 comments)

Users frequently need help choosing between plans. When they get good guidance, it's a major satisfaction driver. When they don't, they feel lost.

**What works:**
> "It was easy to compare healthcare plans side by side."

> "Molly listened well, gave insight into my selection of plans, and based off what I had told her, confirmed the best decision for my family plan"

> "I was in a bind as I had selected a plan that was completely wrong for me. Benefits Bay was able to fix this within 36 hours and I'm back on track with my elections."

> "My customer service representative was wonderful to work with. She took the time to help me review the available insurance plans and find the best fit for me."

**What doesn't:**
> "What was my option and how do I keep my same health insurance"

> "I have been told that I have selected a healthcare plan but have yet to be able to login to the benefit bay system and do not know what this plan costs."

> "The counselor I had could not answer not one of my specific questions in regards to one of the plans I am considering and we didn't even make it to a second plan because she had another meeting."

---

### ICHRA Understanding (Limited but Critical)

ICHRA is a new concept for most users. When it's not explained well, users abandon the process entirely.

**What works:**
> "Kevin was a great help, took his time and explained the plans and allowances."

> "Lauren was very helpful and took great care in helping choose a plan, but I'm still confused as to how my employer is going to help with their contributions. Lauren and I ran out of time before I could understand."

**What doesn't:**
> "I found this whole process of an ICHRA not intuitive and provided little information throughout the process only to find out I didn't qualify. This is concerning because if on-boarding is this difficult, what will a claim be like... In the end, I am choosing to not get medical coverage through my employer mainly because the ICHRA process is nowhere near a mature product. This shopping list approach while great in concept, leaves no confidence on what we can anticipate our level of coverage will be."

**Product Implication:** This user chose to forgo employer coverage entirely due to ICHRA confusion. Clear education about how ICHRA works, what the employer contribution means, and what to expect is critical.

---

### Provider Network Verification (26 comments)

Users rely on BenefitBay's provider search to make plan decisions. When the data is wrong, trust is destroyed.

**What works:**
> "There was a system error with our hospitals and providers not being listed as PCP's for our locations. I used the chat option and was linked to your agent, Dayna Campbell, for assistance. She immediately took ownership of the issue and informed me she would investigate."

> "I had a question about my provider, and it was answered within 24hrs. Very much appreciated."

> "Carlos was incredibly helpful and was able to answer all our questions. He took the time to address any of our concerns or needs."

**What doesn't:**
> "I haven't had any negative issues with your employees. I am completely dissatisfied because when I signed up for insurance this year, it said our PCP was in network and it was wrong!"

> "I recently signed up for health coverage on their site. I checked in their site to see that all my providers were in network. After confirming this, I selected the appropriate plan. I saw my specialist and they said they don't take my insurance and never have. This is very frustrating. I feel like I have been lied to."

> "Little to no guidance on how my PCP wasn't in network on the Avera plan when she works for Avera healthcare. I am a transplant patient from UNMC and they are not covered on plans offered. This liver deal is kind of a big deal. I can't go out of network on that."

**Product Implication:** Provider data accuracy is a trust-or-break issue. Users make year-long commitments based on this information.

---

### Medicare Complexity (8 comments)

Medicare-eligible users face unique complexity and often feel lost in the process.

**What works:**
> "I was having some issues since my husband was already registered for Medicare, but your representatives were very helpful and was able to resolve the issue and answer my questions."

> "Mary is on top of her game. She contacted me when noticing my payment didn't go thru for my Medicare part B."

> "I worked with Jason Permatteo and he was very helpful explaining the information I needed to make a decision and also with referring me to Apollo for my husband's Medicare needs."

**What doesn't:**
> "I am not understanding what I need to do to fix my Medicare stuff. And I can't tell if my messages are going thru."

> "I have Medicare. The process was a nightmare. The webinar was a complete waste of time. At the end of the half hour we are told to call the number. A simple written checklist needs to be sent to accomplish the process."

> "I am being told I must go through Apollo to pick my plans for Medicare, but they do not have a contract for Humana for Medicare Part D and it is the most cost effective plan for me."

**Product Implication:** Medicare users need dedicated guidance and clearer handoffs to Apollo/Medicare specialists.

---

### Confusion & Overwhelm (53 comments)

Enrollment is inherently stressful. Users who feel overwhelmed need extra patience and clarity.

**What works:**
> "Helped me understand the problem I thought I was having. Excellent service."

> "This was all a little overwhelming to me and Mary was so great at walking me through everything and answering all of my questions. She was very knowledgeable and patient."

> "Mary was the best help I have gotten so far! I appreciate her being a real person and understanding me."

> "What do we do? Myself and my wife never had to go through this except the first time we enrolled with medical through my company. My wife now is on Medicare. We are stumped...." *(User reached out for help)*

**What doesn't:**
> "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, unfortunately due to my diabetes when I struggle with High blood sugar it effects my ability to concentrate. I have added my medication and my PCP now just looking for assistance to choose the plan that will cover what I need."

> "I'm very frustrated with the products offered"

> "I sobbed as Carlos patiently explained one terrible choice after the next. I am gutted."

**Product Implication:** The emotional weight of enrollment is real. Empathetic support and simplified decision frameworks matter.

---

### Process Navigation (62 comments)

Users struggle with the enrollment flow, website navigation, and knowing what steps to take.

**What works:**
> "Bill was patient, gave clear directions and explained everything step by step."

> "William Roark did a great job walking me through the enrollment process making sure if I had any questions along the way to answer."

> "User-friendly platform and premium customer service to answer my individual questions via MS Teams. Seamless process!"

**What doesn't:**
> "Every year enrolling through the portal is a nightmare."

> "Not helpful at all very long and unresponsive system process. Network doesn't work. Site doesn't work. Help bots don't help or work. This process was very unsuccessful and repetitive."

> "Your application is absolutely horrendous. Every time I login to review plans the app has changed, information previously available is no longer available."

> "The first meeting, Jason showed an 8 minute video. That could have been an email. Apparently your app is not fully compatible with iPhone. You assume everyone has a computer. Open enrollment that starts during a holiday week, less than optimal. Site not user friendly. Do better."

**Product Implication:** Platform consistency, mobile support, and clear step-by-step guidance are critical.

---

### Family & Dependent Coverage (68 comments)

Covering family members adds complexity. Users need help understanding how to add dependents and what it means for costs.

**What works:**
> "Very pleasant and quick to respond! Molly is doing a great job helping me and my family with a major issue and so far it's been much less stressful than it probably could be for us."

> "Molly has gone above and beyond to try and help me remove my son from my policy. She is very appreciated."

> "I was having some issues since my husband was already registered for Medicare, but your representatives were very helpful and was able to resolve the issue."

**What doesn't:**
> "Can't select my family members to start my enrollment."

> "I need more help. We had a call with Addison and she was great and then we picked the provider and when we went to enroll it had a note about dental coverage and we have new questions on vision and dental coverage and need to speak with someone."

**Product Implication:** Family situations are complex (Medicare spouse, dependent aging out, etc.). The platform should handle these gracefully.

---

### Cost & Premium Concerns (26 comments)

Users are price-sensitive and need to understand what they're paying and why.

**What works:**
> "Karla answered my question quickly. I had a question about my insurance premiums."

> "I just needed to know if I was all set with my direct payment. The answer was prompt and direct."

**What doesn't:**
> "This past Tuesday I was in a personal meeting with Micky, which she was great and it came down to a plan that was 208.19... then today when I had my video chat with Gloria that same plan went up another $80.00 or so from 3 days ago and yes it was the same plan ID # so how in the heck can this be so??? I asked Gloria what do you people do change prices over night??"

> "The insurance plans are way too high"

> "Please don't raise the price of insurance by 38% on my employer and over 5X on me. Thanks."

**Product Implication:** Price changes (or perceived changes) cause major distrust. Clear explanations of cost factors and stable pricing during shopping are important.

## What Makes Users Happy

### 1. Responsive, Knowledgeable Human Support

The most common theme in positive feedback is **appreciation for real humans who respond quickly and know what they're doing**.

**Representative quotes:**

> "Molly was awesome! She helped me with an application that is still pending and reassured me and the employee that they will have coverage while the application is processing."

> "Your team member Mary (at ext 029) was a very helpful, thorough, friendly, patient (etc) help to me. She is truly an asset to Benefit Bay!"

> "Bill was patient, gave clear directions and explained everything step by step."

> "Helped me understand the problem I thought I was having. Excellent service."

> "This was all a little overwhelming to me and Mary was so great at walking me through everything and answering all of my questions."

> "All my questions were answered, and information provided that I didn't even think to ask."

## What Makes Users Unhappy

### 1. Chatbot Frustration (Critical Issue)

The AI/chatbot experience is generating significant negative sentiment. Users find it repetitive, unhelpful, and a barrier to human help.

**Representative quotes:**
> "AI bot asks the same questions multiple times after I've already sent what I need done."

> "Dayna is great. The robo-gatekeeper before her is annoying."

> "Stayed on for too short, also your UX for the chatbot is horrendous and difficult to use. I really prefer to talk to a real actual person with a phone call, not some random chatbot."

> "Horrible its not answering anything im asking"

> "Chat bot asked me the same question 3 times."

> "I was directed to a live chat which was obviously NOT with a real person, then directed to schedule an appointment with a representative. You should of just directed me there in the first place."

**Product Implication:** The chatbot is creating friction rather than resolving issues. Consider clearer escalation paths to humans, reducing repetitive questions, and setting better expectations about bot vs. human availability.

### 2. Unresponsiveness and Ghosting

Users are being left without responses across all channels, leading to frustration and distrust.

**Representative quotes:**
> "I have tried multiple times to get in contact with someone, no one has emailed me or called back."

> "NO HELP, I'VE CHATTED, CALLED AND EMAILED."

> "I was corresponding with a BenefitBay support team member (Hannah Winters), and then she just stopped emailing me, pretty much leaving me to fend for myself."

> "Scheduled calls never happened. Tech chat not helpful. Phoned for support left message no one responded with a return call."

> "no one was available on Saturday to help me"

> "I never connected with a representative. I sent an email, and it was never responded to."

**Product Implication:** Need better queue management, SLA visibility, and fallback mechanisms when agents aren't available.

### 3. Platform/Website Technical Issues

Users encounter friction with the enrollment platform itself — login issues, site errors, and confusing UX.

**Representative quotes:**
> "All that day and the next your website said that my internet was out. This site was no help."

> "Passwords allow me in but can't send benefits choice"

> "Chat bot asked me the same question 3 times. Website not working properly, kept giving me an error message to try again later."

> "My problem has not been solved. I can not verify my information, the site keeps telling me that my ss number has already been used?????"

> "Your application is absolutely horrendous. Every time I login to review plans the app has changed, information previously available is no longer available."

> "Can't select my family members to start my enrollment."

**Product Implication:** Platform stability and UX consistency need attention. Login/authentication issues are blocking enrollment.

### 4. Provider Network Inaccuracy (Trust Issue)

Users are discovering that provider information shown during shopping is incorrect, leading to wrong plan selection.

**Representative quotes:**
> "I haven't had any negative issues with your employees. I am completely dissatisfied because when I signed up for insurance this year, it said our PCP was in network and it was wrong!"

> "I recently signed up for health coverage on their site. I checked in their site to see that all my providers were in network. After confirming this, I selected the appropriate plan. I saw my specialist and they said they don't take my insurance and never have. This is very frustrating. I feel like I have been lied to."

> "Your data base of clinics and hospitals needs to be updated. It was frustrating to use the system to enter my plan in."

> "I signed up for EPO but was given HMO. Now I am stuck for a year. This is a scam!!!"

> "little to no guidance on how my PCP wasn't in network on the Avera plan when she works for Avera healthcare."

**Product Implication:** This is a major trust issue. Incorrect provider data leads to users selecting the wrong plan and feeling deceived. Provider directory accuracy should be a priority.

### 5. Enrollment Window and Timing Issues

Users feel rushed by short enrollment windows and encounter deadline-related stress.

**Representative quotes:**
> "The enrollment window was extremely short, and the process itself was difficult to navigate. I spent approximately three hours on the phone with Blue Cross Blue Shield, being transferred multiple times."

> "Missed open enrollment by a day. Now I have no insurance all year. Terrible"

> "Was not allowed to reshop; benefits close today."

> "Well I missed open enrollment since no one got back to me in time to talk me through it to understand more"

> "Open enrollment that starts during a holiday week, less than optimal."

**Product Implication:** Consider more proactive deadline reminders, longer windows where possible, and better communication about timing.

### 6. Preference for Human Contact

Many users explicitly state they want phone calls, not chat or email.

**Representative quotes:**
> "I would greatly appreciate an in person meeting or at the very least an actual person on a phone call."

> "I am unable to log into benefit bay and no one will help me. I have called and emailed several times. I need to speak to an actual human being."

> "I need to speak with a person not a robot on text"

> "To start, no one ever answers the phone. The only customer service ever rendered is an email reply. No one is ever able to pick up a phone and help resolve the issue at hand. Never."

**Product Implication:** While digital-first is efficient, high-stakes moments (enrollment decisions, complex issues) need clear phone/video options.
