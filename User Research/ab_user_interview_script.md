# A/B User Interview Script - Recommendations

## Overall Assessment

The script is solid and follows good usability testing practices. The A/B comparison structure (recent experience → prototype → comparison) will yield useful insights. Below are specific recommendations organized by section.

---

## General Recommendations

### 1. Add a Warm-Up / Rapport Section
Before diving into the confidence rating, consider 1-2 minutes of light context-gathering:
- "What's your role at [company]?"
- "Is this your first time enrolling through BenefitBay, or have you done this before?"

This helps participants relax and gives you segmentation data.

### 2. Clarify the "Think Aloud" Protocol
After your intro, explicitly prompt: *"As you go through this, please think out loud — tell me what you're looking at, what you're thinking, even if it seems obvious."* Participants often forget unless reminded.

### 3. Prepare Probes for Silence
Have ready: "What are you looking for?" / "What do you expect to happen?" / "Is this what you expected?" for moments when participants go quiet.

## Section-Specific Feedback

### Recent Experience

| Question | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Q1 & Q5 (confidence & ease scales) | Consider anchoring the scale: "Where 1 is not at all confident and 10 is completely confident." Otherwise participants interpret scales differently. |
| Q2 ("Why?") | Good follow-up, but be ready with probes if they give a short answer: "Can you tell me more about that?" |
| Q6 & Q7 (employer/employee contribution recall) | These are great — they test comprehension of a key concept. Note: many participants won't remember. That's a finding in itself. Consider asking *"Do you feel like you understood it at the time?"* as a follow-up. |

**Suggested addition:**
- *"Did you use any resources outside of BenefitBay to help you decide? (e.g., spouse, HR, Google)"* — This reveals trust gaps.

---

### Getting Started with the Prototype

| Issue | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Scenario framing is good | Consider printing/displaying the persona card so they can reference it. Cognitive load of remembering "Jerry Anders" details can distract from the task. |
| "You know how it works" | Be careful — this assumes confidence. Some participants may have been confused the first time. Rephrase: *"You recently went through enrollment, so some of this may feel familiar."* |

---

### Understand the Goal / First Screen

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| "How would you move forward?" | Good open-ended prompt. Add: *"What stands out to you on this screen?"* before asking about next steps. This captures first impressions. |

---

### Verify Personal Information

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| "What is necessary to complete this task?" | Slightly leading — implies there's something specific. Try: *"Walk me through what you see here and what you would do."* |
| Address change task | Good task. After they complete it, ask: *"Was that easier or harder than you expected?"* |
| "Why is address important?" | Excellent question — tests whether the UI communicates the plan availability / network implications. |

---

### Shopping / Medical Plans

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Provider search task | Good specific task. One clarification: is "Greensboro Associates Doctors" the exact string they need to type? If the prototype has specific search behavior, test with a realistic typo scenario too (e.g., "greensboro" lowercase). |
| Zip code 64106 | Make sure Jerry's address actually matches this zip in the prototype, or participants may be confused. |

**Suggested addition:**
- *"If you couldn't find your doctor in the search, what would you do?"* — Tests fallback behavior understanding.

---

### Compare Plan Options

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| "What are the most important aspects..." | Great question. Be ready to probe on: premium vs. deductible tradeoff, network type, out-of-pocket max. |
| "What would you do to find out more?" | Good. If they struggle, note it — this tests discoverability of plan details. |

**Suggested addition:**
- *"Is there anything on this screen that's confusing or unclear?"* — Direct invitation to critique.

---

### Medical Plan Details

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| "Is there anything confusing?" | Good. Also ask: *"Is there any term or number here you don't understand?"* — More specific, catches jargon issues (e.g., "coinsurance," "out-of-pocket max"). |

**Suggested addition:**
- *"If you wanted to know whether your prescription is covered under this plan, what would you do?"* — Tests formulary/drug coverage discoverability (a known pain point).

---

### Add Family Coverage / Plan Selection

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| "Please select Ambetter Gold 2400" | This is directive — good for keeping the test moving, but you lose the insight of *which* plan they would have chosen. Consider: *"Which plan would you select for Jerry's situation?"* first, then redirect if needed. |

---

### Review Enrollment Selections

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| HIPAA / ICHRA listed as bullets | These seem like prompts for you, not questions. Clarify: Are you asking *"What do you think HIPAA means here?"* or just reminding yourself to observe their reaction? If you want to test comprehension, ask: *"Do you know what this ICHRA acknowledgment means?"* |

**Suggested addition:**
- *"Is there anything you would want to change before confirming?"* — Tests edit/back navigation.

---

### Confirmation (Post-Prototype)

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Confidence scale (Q1) | Great parallel to the opening question — allows direct comparison. |
| "How does this compare to {last week}?" | Excellent. Probe for specifics: *"What was better? What was worse?"* |
| Time estimate question | Good. Consider adding: *"Did this feel rushed, about right, or too long?"* — Perception matters as much as actual time. |

---

### Renewal Flow

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Contribution recall (again) | Smart to re-test after they've seen the new UI. If they remember better now, the new design is teaching effectively. |
| "Identify what has changed" | Good task. Be specific about what you're testing: year-over-year cost changes? Plan availability? Employer contribution changes? |
| "Renew last year's plan" | Directive task — fine for flow testing. |

---

### Renewal Plan Selection / Comparison

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| "Is it clear which plan is current?" | Good direct question. |
| "Select the cheaper plan" | Good task to test comprehension of cost display. Note: "cheaper" could mean premium or total cost — participants may interpret differently. Consider: *"Select the plan with the lower monthly premium."* |

---

### Final Questions

| Current | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Only one final question | Consider adding: |

**Suggested additions:**
- *"If you could change one thing about this experience, what would it be?"*
- *"Is there anything you wish you had known before starting?"*
- *"Would you recommend this enrollment process to a coworker? Why or why not?"*
- *"Any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share?"*

## Logistics Recommendations

1. **Session length estimate:** This script looks like 45-60 minutes. Confirm participants are scheduled for enough time.

2. **Recording consent:** Add a reminder to get verbal consent for recording at the start.

3. **Prototype failures:** Have a plan for if the prototype breaks. ("If something doesn't work as expected, that's helpful feedback too — just tell me what you expected to happen.")

4. **Note-taker:** If possible, have someone else take notes so you can focus on the participant.

5. **Participant incentive:** Not in scope for the script, but confirm compensation is set.

---

## Summary: Top 5 Changes to Make

1. **Anchor your rating scales** (1 = not at all, 10 = completely)
2. **Add "think aloud" prompt** at the start of the prototype section
3. **Expand final questions** — you're leaving insights on the table
4. **Clarify HIPAA/ICHRA section** — are these observation prompts or comprehension questions?
5. **Add a prescription/formulary question** during plan details review

## Optional: Suggested Metrics to Track

| Metric | How to Capture |
|--------|----------------|
| Task success rate | Did they complete each task without help? |
| Time on task | Stopwatch key sections (plan comparison, provider search) |
| Confidence delta | Pre vs. post confidence rating |
| Error rate | How many wrong clicks / backtracks? |
| Comprehension | Can they recall contribution amounts? Explain ICHRA? |
