# What is this?

<aside>
💡

*Describe the rough shape of how we might tackle the problem. For example, if the problem was “discoverability of new features”, then this might be “a notification center for relevant features”.* 

</aside>

# Problem Alignment

---

*Describe the problem we are trying to solve in one short paragraph. I should be able to read this alone and communicate the value/risks to someone else.*

- *Why does this matter to our customers and business?*
- *What evidence or insights do you have to support this?*

### Goals + Outcomes

| Metric | What It Tells Us | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High Level Goals *(ex. Contact Rate)*** | Describe the high level *(ex. Do users feel comfortable asking for help?)* | Include measurable metrics (Ex. eual to current baseline of 25%) |
| **In Priority Order** | So we know  | And immeasurable (feelings, qualitative feedback, etc.) goals |
| **Not Too Many** | Keep it short and sweet | And a link to reporting when ready. |

# Solution Alignment

---

### In Scope

1. *List features that shape the solution*
2. *In priority order*
3. *Draw the boundaries so team can focus on how to fill lit in*
4. *Link to sub-docs when features require more detail on a larger project*

### Out of Scope

1.  *Future considerations*
2. *Optional, but might inform how we design, architect + build now*

### Guiding Principles

1. *Anything we shouldn’t lose sight of during the process*
2. *Ex. HIPAA Compliance*

# Key Flows

---

*These flows are starting points for us to refine together. They will change and become more detailed as we iterate.* 

- **Flow 1**
    
    *Show what the end-to-end experience will be for customers. This could be written prose, a flow diagram, screenshots, or design explorations. It will vary by project and team, and iterate over time. Work with product design and engineering to complete.*
