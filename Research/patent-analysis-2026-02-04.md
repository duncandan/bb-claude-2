## ICHRA/Health Benefits Technology Landscape

**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Prepared for:** BenefitBay
**Competitors Analyzed:** SureCo, Take Command, Remodel Health, Zorro, Thatch, Bavvy

---

## Executive Summary

> **IMPORTANT: 18-Month Publication Delay**
>
> Patent applications are **not published until 18 months after filing**. This research found no granted patents or published applications for any competitor. However, applications filed after **August 2024** would not yet be publicly visible.
>
> Given recent funding rounds:
> - **Zorro** raised $20M in June 2025 (any filings since Aug 2024 not yet public)
> - **Thatch** raised $40M in April 2025 (any filings since Aug 2024 not yet public)
> - **SureCo** raised $23M in September 2025 (any filings since Aug 2024 not yet public)
>
> **Any of these companies could have filed patent applications in 2025 that won't be published until mid-2026 or later.** This report should be refreshed in Q3 2026 to capture any pending applications.

### Key Finding: No Published Patents or Applications Found

After extensive searches across USPTO, Google Patents, and related databases, **no granted patents or published patent applications were found directly assigned to any of the six ICHRA competitors analyzed**. This finding is significant for several reasons:

1. **The ICHRA market is relatively young** (regulations finalized in 2019, effective 2020)
2. **Competitors are focused on execution** rather than IP protection
3. **This presents a strategic opportunity** for BenefitBay to establish patent protection for key innovations

### Patents Found Per Competitor

| Competitor | Direct Patents Found | Related/Acquired IP |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| SureCo | 0 | Possible via Hixme acquisition/spinout |
| Take Command | 0 | None identified |
| Remodel Health | 0 | None identified |
| Zorro | 0 | None identified |
| **Thatch** | **1 (pending)** | **US20240265464A1 - Healthcare transactions** |
| Bavvy (Milliman) | 0 | Parent company may have broader portfolio |

### Recommended Actions

1. **URGENT: Review Thatch patent US20240265464A1** for freedom-to-operate implications on any BenefitBay payment/reimbursement features
2. **File provisional patents** on FULCRUM AI innovations before competitors recognize the opportunity
3. **Monitor Milliman's patent portfolio** (Bavvy's parent company) for relevant filings
4. **Track Hixme-related IP** given SureCo's connection to that company
5. **Consider freedom-to-operate analysis** for the adjacent patents identified below

   - Monitor USPTO for filings by: SureCo, Take Command, Remodel Health, Zorro, Thatch, Milliman
   - Keywords: ICHRA, health reimbursement arrangement, benefits enrollment AI

4. **Track Zorro Closely**
   - Israeli company with strong AI claims
   - Most likely competitor to file patents given technology focus

### Long-Term Strategy

5. **Build Patent Portfolio**
   - Each FULCRUM enhancement is a potential patent
   - AI features are particularly valuable for patent protection
   - Consider design patents for unique UI innovations

6. **Freedom-to-Operate Analysis**
   - Before launching FULCRUM AI, conduct full FTO study
   - Review any new competitor filings

## Appendix: Search Methodology

### Databases Searched
- Google Patents (patents.google.com)
- USPTO PatFT (granted patents)
- USPTO AppFT (applications)
- Justia Patents

### Search Queries Used
- Company name + "patent"
- Company name + "ICHRA"
- Founder names + "patent" + "inventor"
- "health reimbursement arrangement" + technology terms
- "ICHRA" + "patent"
- AI + health insurance + plan recommendation

### Limitations
- **18-month publication delay**: Patent applications filed after August 2024 are not yet publicly visible. Given the significant funding rounds in 2025, competitors may have filed applications that won't publish until Q3-Q4 2026.
- **International patent databases** (EPO, WIPO, Israeli Patent Office) not fully searched - particularly relevant for Zorro (Israeli company)
- **Subsidiary/legal entity variations**: Companies may file under different legal names not captured in searches
- **Acquired IP**: Patents from predecessors or acquired companies may not be easily linked (e.g., Hixme → SureCo connection)

### Recommended Follow-Up
- **Re-run this analysis in August 2026** to capture any 2025 filings
- **Set USPTO patent alerts** for company names and key ICHRA terms
- **Search Israeli Patent Office** for Zorro filings specifically

### Search Methodology Note
The initial automated search missed Thatch's US20240265464A1 application. Future searches should include:
- Direct USPTO AppFT searches by company legal name (e.g., "Thatch Health Inc")
- Inventor name searches for known founders
- Publication number pattern searches for recent filings
- Manual verification of results against USPTO Public PAIR database
